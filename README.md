Hi Everyone!

The past 4 weeks I had the opportunity to be apart of the Codsoft Team as a Web Developer Intern. 
I spent my time working on various projects which allowed me to test my skills and learn along the way.
I have designed and coded the following tasks thus far:

1. Basic Calculator Project  - https://tamsyn-october-calculator-codsoft.netlify.app/ 
   This project involved implementing an interactive interface with buttons that allow sums such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
   operations. The calculator displays a screen to show user input and results. The calculator is able to perform various calculations due to the usage of
   if-else statements and operators to handle user input. CSS grid system was used to alignment buttons to create the basic calculator.
   HTML - CSS - Javascript

2. Landing Page Project - https://tamsyn-october-landingpage-codsoft.netlify.app/ 
   This user-friendly project design  involved creating columns, different sections, arranging items, and adding headers and footers. It also required
   using alignments, padding, colour palettes, boxes, and other elements. 
   HTML - CSS
