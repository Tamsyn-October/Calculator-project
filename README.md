My Basic Calculator Project involved implementing an interactive interface with buttons that allow sums such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator displays a screen to show user input and results. The calculator is able to perform various calculations due to the usage of if-else statements and operators to handle user input. CSS grid system was used to align buttons to create the basic calculator.
