Hi Everyone!

During my time as a Web Developer Intern at Codsoft, I had the opportunity to work on my software development skills. 
I spent my time working on various projects which allowed me to test my skills and learn along the way.

My Basic Calculator Project involved implementing an interactive interface with buttons that allow sums such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator displays a screen to show user input and results. The calculator is able to perform various calculations due to the usage of if-else statements and operators to handle user input. CSS grid system was used to align buttons to create the basic calculator.
